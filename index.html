        I am an application developer with more than 10 years working for difference clients on large scale
        corporate applications. As a contract programmer, I have worked on Card Management and Authorization,
        Account Receivable, Prescription Clamis Adjudication, and Automated Clearing House applictions for my most
        recent clients. My experience to date has been writing COBOL/SQL applictaions on HP Nonstop machines. I am
        expanding my horizons to learn Oracle, Java, Python, and Full Stack Technologies.

        Hobbies: Income Tax Preparation (ok, it's a part time job). I've been doing it almost as long as I've been
        programming. When I started, I was working in a shop where my monitor was facing the corner with my back to
        the world. Doing taxes gave me the chance to turn around and talk to people. Other hobbies - watching
        Nascar, playing games on facebook.
